Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) steganography is a sophisticated data hiding technique that operates in the frequency domain to embed secret information within digital images. Unlike spatial domain methods, DWT steganography transforms images into different frequency components, making it more robust against various attacks and providing better security for hidden data.

Understanding Discrete Wavelet Transform
Basic Concepts :-

The Discrete Wavelet Transform decomposes an image into multiple frequency bands by applying wavelet functions that analyze signals at different scales and resolutions. In two-dimensional applications, DWT processes the image in both vertical and horizontal directions, creating four distinct sub-bands after each level of decomposition:

LL (Low-Low): Contains the approximation coefficients with most important image details

LH (Low-High): Contains horizontal edge information

HL (High-Low): Contains vertical edge information

HH (High-High): Contains diagonal edge information

Wavelet Properties for Steganography :-

DWT possesses several properties that make it particularly suitable for steganography applications:

Excellent space-frequency localization: Allows precise control over where data is embedded

Multi-resolution analysis: Provides different levels of detail for embedding

Human Visual System compatibility: Closely matches how human eyes process visual information
Edge detection capabilities: High-frequency sub-bands locate image features less sensitive to human perception
